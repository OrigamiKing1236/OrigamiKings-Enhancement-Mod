I didn't know what to name this file but...

I used some texture from [Quark](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/quark)

I also used some textures from [Charm](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/charm)

I also used some textures from [More Slabs, Stairs, and Walls](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/more-slabs-stairs-and-walls)

The last mod's textures I used was [Everything is Copper](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/everythingcopper)

I used some code from [Enchanted Vertical Slabs](https://modrinth.com/mod/enchanted-vertical-slabs)

If I cant use this please make an issue on github and I will fix any problems
